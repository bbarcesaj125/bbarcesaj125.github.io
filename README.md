This repository hosts the source code of **[tootips.com](https://www.tootips.com)**
Tootips is a blog centered around the world of Linux and open source applications in general. It was started back in 2012, and was recently migrated from _Blogger_ to _Jekyll_.
This installation uses a forked version of the notorious **[Minimal Mistakes'](https://github.com/bbarcesaj125/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme**.

During the migration process, I used the builtin Jekyll Blogger importer to import my old posts from the Blogger platform to Jekyll.
I also wrote a python script ´post_parse.py´ to batch process the imported Blogger posts so that they will be compatible with the new theme. You can find this script in the ´_scripts´ directory.
