We are migrating our blog to Jekyll. For those of you who don't know Jekyll, it is one of the most popular static website generator on the Internet.
It is also used by **Github Pages**.
As I said, in the last couple of days, I was migrating the entire _Tootips_ website from Blogger to Jekyll. As you may have guessed, the transition process was mostly seemless although I had to write a Python script to batch process all my Blogger posts so that they will display correctly using the new Jekyll theme.

The rest of this post represents the Jekyll's welcome post that gets created with every new Jekyll installation. I could have deleted it, but I preferred to keep it to serve as a reminder of this new milestone of _Tootips_.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
